### Use IP api, weather api, aladhan api 


We created a simple program that get the weather condition, the wind condition and its speed, the location of the user as well as Hijri calendar at the moment of running the application and post it to a Facebook page. We used IP API to retrieve the location of the user. We used Weather bit API to get the weather and wind information. We used Aladhan API to get the time of running the application and retrieve the Hijri date of the day. Finally, we used the FacebookGraph to post this information on a Facebook page.
